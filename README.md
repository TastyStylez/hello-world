# hello-world
This is MY repository and no one else's, there are many repositories like it, but this one is mine!
Hello, my name is Richard. I am a creative minded individual. I love life, learning, and progress. I get anxious when I see no movement. I have mild insomnia, due to my anxiety and find it hard to stop thinking. My mind is always going full throttle, I imagine my trains of thought to look something like electricity sparking around, instantly moving lightyears in the blink of an eye. If I lose my train of thought it causes me great distress. I envision myself creating devine technology of the future and moving society like it is a mountain. I have always had a certain discipline to my exsitence and view my learning almost as a file directory. I love clear communication as it is key to progress. I love beauty and semitry. I love nature. I love women. I love feeling good. I love positive thinking. I love intellegence. I love steak and mashed potatoes. I love the outdoors. I love freshair. I love thinking. I love being honest. I love this world. I love all the people of this world. My ultimate goal would be to make the world a better place, to leave this world better than it was when I arrived here. I hate waste. I love efficiency. My mind is structured around finding the best way. Thank you for your time in reading this, I hope you leave this repository with a better understanding of me as a person.
